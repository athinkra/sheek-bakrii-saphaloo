Qubee Bakrii Saphaloo font family
=================================
The "Qubee Sheek Bakrii Saphaloo" typeface is derived directly from the "JG Oromo"
TrueType font created by Jason Glavy. The font was released under the OpenFont
Licese v1.1 on August 28, 2023.

The "Qubee Sheek Bakrii Saphaloo" typeface is identical to its companion,
"Athinkra Sheek Bakrii Saphaloo", but adds Contextual Alternatives (calt)
definitions to support mapping of Qubee Latin text to Sheek akri Saphaloo glyphs.

All modifications to the original JG Oromo font are detailed in the following:


Version 1.0
-----------
* Characters are relocated into the Unicode Private Use Area beginning from
  address range U+E000.

* CALT tables have been added to remap Latin Qubee sequences to Sheik Bakri Sapalo equivalents.

* UPM size scaled from 1000 to 2048.

* The Full Stop glyph is changed from four dots to two horizontal strokes.
