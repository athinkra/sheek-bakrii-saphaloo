# The Athinkra Sheek Bakrii Saphaloo Font

This repository contains the source assets for a font supporting the Shaaldaa script.
The Shaaldaa  script in turn contains 804 symbols: 792 syllables, 2 punctuation marks, 
and 10 digital numbers.

The font was originally created by Jason Glavy in 2006 for the [Athinkra](https://www.athinkra.com/) project and distributed
under the name "JG Oromo".  The Athinkra project placed the font under the [OFL](https://scripts.sil.org/OFL) license in 2023,
this project updates the OFL release to relocate the glyphs into the Private Use Area (first release). Later, the
glyphs were reencoded under the Unicode 19 provisional encoding for Shaaldaa script:  U+1C800 - U+1CB2B.
See the [FONTLOG.txt](FONTLOG-Athinkra-Sheek-Bakrii-Saphaloo.txt) file in this directory for a list of additional changes.

Note also that the glyphs of the initial release (v1.0) of the font reflects the handwriting style of Sheek Mahammad Rashad
(a student of Sheek Bakrii Saphaloo).
The following releases modified a number of glyphs to better reflect the handwriting of Sheek Bakrii Saphaloo. As the creator
of the script, Sheek Bakrii Saphaloo's handwriting is considered to be the canonomical form of all glyphs.

## Keyman Keyboard
An experimental [Keyman](https://keyman.com/) keyboard is available that works with the encoding of the font. 
The keyboard is available at [this link](https://keyman.com/keyboards/gff_sbs).
