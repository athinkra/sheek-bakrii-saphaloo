# The Athinkra Sheek Bakrii Saphaloo Font

This repository contains the source assets for a font supporting the Sheek Bakrii Saphaloo script.
The Sheek Bakrii Saphaloo script in turn contains 804 symbols: 792 syllables, 2 punctuation marks, 
and 10 digital numbers.

The font was originally created by Jason Glavy in 2006 for the [Athinkra](https://www.athinkra.com/) project and distributed
under the name "JG Oromo".  The Athinkra project placed the font under the [OFL](https://scripts.sil.org/OFL) license in 2023,
this project updates the OFL release to relocate the glyphs into the Private Use Area.  See the [FONTLOG.txt](FONTLOG.txt)
file in this directory for a list of additional changes.

## Keyman Keyboard
An experimental [Keyman](https://keyman.com/) keyboard is available that works with the encoding of the font. 
The keyboard is available at [this link](https://keyman.com/keyboards/gff_sbs).
